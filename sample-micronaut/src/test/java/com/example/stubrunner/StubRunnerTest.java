/**
 * Base class for Micronaut tests that need Stubborn Contract stubs running before the
 * application context is created.
 *
 * <p>
 * It implements {@link TestPropertyProvider}, the blessed Micronaut Test seam that
 * supplies properties <em>before</em> the {@code ApplicationContext} starts. The stubs
 * are downloaded and started inside {@link #getProperties()} and their coordinates are
 * exposed as configuration properties (see {@link StubRunnerSupport#toProperties()}), so
 * that {@code @Client} interfaces and {@code @Value} injected URLs already point at the
 * running stubs when the context comes up.
 *
 * <p>
 * A subclass supplies at minimum the stub coordinates by overriding {@link #stubIds()}
 * and may tune the resolution mode, repository root and port range. Because
 * {@link TestPropertyProvider} requires a per-class test instance, this base class is
 * annotated with {@link TestInstance.Lifecycle#PER_CLASS}; subclasses inherit it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typical usage: a {@code @MicronautTest} subclass overrides {@link #stubIds()} to return
 * {@code "com.example:beer-api-producer"} and injects a {@code @Client} that resolves its
 * base URL from the {@code stubborn.contract.stubrunner.runningstubs.*.url} property. See
 * {@code docs/integrations/micronaut.md} for a full worked example.
